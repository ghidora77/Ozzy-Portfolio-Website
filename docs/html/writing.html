        <h3>The Craft of Writing</h3>
            <p>Writing makes you think - what do you want to communicate, what
            point are you trying to make, who are you communicating with? The
            act of writing hones mastery, and I believe in communicating information
            that is clear, concise and readable. To that end, I hope to provide a distraction-free environment
            to interact with the content. While there is an abundance of information in textbooks, newspapers, the internet and in scientific journals, it can be overwhelming to
            read complex, complicated documents that are more about the writer's
            ego than the reader, or navigate websites that are covered with ads
            and distracting gimmicks. I hope you find these articles fun to
            read, but most importantly, enlightening.</p>

            <p>There is relatively broad range of topics in the articles below,
            ranging from business analysis to international relations to essays in philosophy, but all have a common theme; using analytical thinking to understand and improve the world around us. Feel free to
            read any of the papers, ask questions and let me know if you have any
            comments or suggestions. I've separated data and programming papers into the 'Data Science' tab, while this page falls more into the humanities category.</p>

        <h4>International Affairs</h4>
            <p>As a society, we need to use the tools at our disposal to improve
            the global environment. After several years working on complex, cross-cultural
            issues in the military, I've found that the same type of analytical
            thinking in data and computer science can be applied to international
            affairs, which has traditionally been driven by instinct and cherry-picked
			information. I approach the subject by finding accurate data and sound reasoning to improve
            decision-making within global affairs. </p>

        <h4>World War I</h4>
            <p>I've been fascinated by this era for as long as I can remember. I had the honor of being in Verdun, France on Veteran's day. Walking along the mile of fog-shrounded, 12 foot tall statues of soldiers and through the dark recesses of the citadel was chilling. I respect the sacrifices, and would like to ensure that these stories are not forgotten. </p>

        <h4>Middle East Studies</h4>
            <p>I spent a year and a half in Jerusalem on a fellowship to study the Middle East. The area is rich in culture, history, and intrigue, and I found myself drawn to the region. From spending the nights under the cliffs at Wadi Rum to riding my bike down every street in Jerusalem, there is so much to explore and better understand.</p>
