		<h2>About Me</h2>
        
		<p>I'm currently a PhD candidate at Virginia Tech, researching Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis. Before that, I was a military officer with deployments throughout SouthEast Asia and the Middle East. I completed a masters in Ancient and Classical History annd was an academic fellow at Hebrew University, in Jerusalem, where I studied the Middle East, Hebrew and Arabic, and travelled around the region. After living a few months in Europe, I returned to the United States, transitioned into data and programming, owned a small business and started working  in technology development.</p>

		  <h4>My Work</h4>
        
		  <p>I was going through my papers from college and graduate school, and realized that I had 179 of them - essays, long-form, history, scientific, philsophical, etc. Some could probably be trashed, some aren't worth publishing, but I hope that some of them are enjoyable and insightful. Rather than just let them sit in electronic folders, I figured I'd go through them all, one-by-one, clean them up, and start finding a way to connect the dots. For instance, one paper documents the evolution of the Iranian military since the Revolution - how can I expand on that? Are there connections between the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, American technology development in the 1980's and demographic changes in Israel? We live in a global, hyper-connected world, where developments in one arena affect many other developments, oftentimes unseen.</p>
		  
		  <p>My current research is in Remote Sensing and Geospatial analysis, using data analysis and machine learning techniques to glean insights from imagery. As a simple explanation, given a satellige image, a human is pretty good at identifying an aircraft or a mine or a road. But what that human is not good at is looking through a hundred billion of those images and craft a cohesive assessment of what is going on. There are techniques to 'train' a computer using machine learning to identify certain objects, allowing the human to make detailed assessments about what is going on. Over-time, I hope to use my research in Remote Sensing to better connect-the-dots</p>
